Focus areas:

- Unit tests (JUnit 5, Mockito)

- Integration tests (SpringBootTest, Testcontainers)

- API tests (MockMvc, WebTestClient)

- Edge cases and failure scenarios

- Test performance and reliability



Output:

- Test classes aligned with existing package structure

- High-coverage scenarios, not trivial tests

- Clear assertions and deterministic setups
